For Grad TA:

-Reordering textboxes and images is done with a drag and drop list of items that can be accessed by the "Layers" tab in the edit sidebar of the logo editing screens. Here, you can also delete layers or edit individual layers.

-Resizing images can be done by hovering over the image itself and then clicking and resizing from the sides or corners of the image box. 

-Images will only be loaded into the page if the image is from a website domain that has CORS configured.
